                    Word Hunt is a mini-game released by GamePigeon, an iMessage extension. It features a 4x4 grid of letters. You and your opponent each
                    have 1 minute and 20 seconds to find as many words as possible. To form a word, connect adjacent letters; however, each letter tile 
                    can only be used once per word. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins!
